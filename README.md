## Purpose

Clothesn'stuff was made in respose to the growing popularity of buying clothes and jewelry items through social media platforms. 
Thus its purpose includes:
- Acting as a landing page for traffic coming off socials
- Allowing traffic to browse through a wider selection of items 
- Displaying the aesthetics and image of the brand

These goals were achieved through the incorporation of social media in the landing page's "slideshow'.
The simplistic and reactive navigation menu.
Lastly, through CSS ( colors, gifs, fonts and picture placement ) the brand image was conveyed.
